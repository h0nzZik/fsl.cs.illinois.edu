  abstract: Analysis of execution traces plays a fundamental role in many program
    analysis approaches, such as runtime verification, testing, monitoring, and specification
    mining. Execution traces are frequently parametric, i.e., they contain events
    with parameter bindings. Each parametric trace usually consists of many meaningful
    trace slices merged together, each slice corresponding to one parameter binding.
    This gives a semantics-based solution to parametric trace analysis. A general-purpose
    parametric trace slicing technique is introduced, which takes each event in the
    parametric trace and dispatches it to its corresponding trace slices. This parametric
    trace slicing technique can be used in combination with any conventional, non-parametric
    trace analysis technique, by applying the later on each trace slice. As an instance,
    a parametric property monitoring technique is then presented. The presented parametric
    trace slicing and monitoring techniques have been implemented and extensively
    evaluated. Measurements of runtime overhead confirm that the generality of the
    discussed techniques does not come at a performance expense when compared with
    existing parametric trace monitoring systems.
