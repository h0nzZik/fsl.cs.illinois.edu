Welcome to the **Formal Systems Laboratory (FSL)** of the [Department of Computer
Science] at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] (UIUC). FSL was
founded in 2002 by [Grigore Rosu](/fsl//people/grigore-rosu/index.html), when he joined UIUC 
(from [NASA Ames](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html)). 
In the FSL, we design and develop:

-   foundational and theoretical models,
-   specification and programming languages, techniques and methodologies,
    as well as
-   software analysis prototypes and tools,

all aiming at increasing the quality of computing systems. 

# Current Research Areas

- [Programming Language Design and Semantics](/fsl//projects/pl/index.html)
- [Runtime Verification](/fsl//projects/rv/index.html)
- [Behavioral Specification](/fsl//projects/circ/index.html)

You want to work on these topics? See [Grigore Rosu](/fsl//people/grigore-rosu/index.html)'s list of [Open Problems and Challenges](/fsl//other-pages/open-problems.html).
