## Quotes

- What can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence. --- Ludwig Wittgenstein.
- Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them. --- John von Neumann.
- What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease. --- Sun Tzu, The Art of War.
- Thus, if you do not accumulate little steps, you will not have the means to journey a thousand li, and if you do not pile up small streams, you will have no way to fill a river or a sea. --- Xunzi, Encouraging Learning.

## Fun

- I am a dan player of [the game of Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)).
- I watched [Stand and Deliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_and_Deliver) at my young age. It is a great film.
